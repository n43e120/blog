## Animal World View

Human is an animal, people are animals.

Living in human society, is no significant different living in the jungles of amazon.

When you visit a zoo, it is difficult to tell animal watching you or you watching animal, which part is the zoo, in the cage or outside the cage.

Just like wildlife animal living in wild, a wild animal could get killed or eaten by other animal.

General speaking, people might find themselves difficulty on finding motivation to make you better, but easily find motivations to make your worse. ranged from:

* make fun / laugh at

* joke / mock

* prank

* lying / fool / hoax / brain wash

* cheat money / emotion

* fraud

* steal / robbery

* hurt

* crime

* felony

  One should feel lucky if have not get hurt.

  It sounds ridiculous there is no universe space of love fulfilled.

  there is no God.

  there is no next life.

  there is no future society.

  What exists is a bunch of animals eat and poop day after day.

## Personality Claim

my rights and personal safety and dignity is supported.

I don't say doe not means that I don't know.

I don't say doe not means that something is not existed.

I don't say doe not means I won't do.

I don't do does not means I am less determined or less powerful.

If that move doesn't move today, that must means I have more moves to consider. but it will eventually happen in the future by any mean before checkmate.

> Do not mess around. 
>
> Try to be nice, friendly and cooperative with me that I'm really pleasure to see.
>
> I am not an easily target and make you no good yield.
>
> Do not play fire, that backfire will eventually kill you.
